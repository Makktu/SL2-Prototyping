# SpaceLander 2 - Prototyping

### 16 January 2023

Started to develop SpaceLander2 ('SL2' from now on). Still at the very early stage of deciding what game mechanics to include. This project is purely a sandbox to test out a few new ideas – starting with the 'Pulser'. This will be a weapon that the SpaceLander of this new game will be able to fire to damage/destroy enemies and obstacles. It will only fire when 'energy' is above a certain amount. Energy will then take time to replenish. The player will have to be cautious about using and overusing the Pulser.

##### Today:

- Set up the playing canvas
- Added the Godot sprite as a placeholder
- Added basic movement

### 23 January 2023

Added a few concept art screenshots for the ship to fly around in while I work on the movement code. Generic sci-fi track from the Internet.

- Refined the movement code – now something close to a starting point for developing the game around it. Another 20% or so to go here.
- Added a big concept art piece – an AI art-generated sci-fi skyscraper. Just to set the mood and see how it works out. Answer: on a mobile screen, not very well. Would have to use lots of dynamic camera zoom-out for there to be any point at all in having broad-scale visuals. Maybe worth a one-off or two.
- Added a proper SpaceLander sprite – another placeholder really, but better than the OG Lander from SL1.

### 19 February 2023

Resumed close work on this. Added collision polygon to the prototype map. Added collision damage flash. This is still just a prototype.

### 25 February 2023

Added 'energy pulse' animation. Nothing for it to do currently without on-screen enemies yet.

Trying to change environment. Backgrounds currently don't work aesthetically.

### 27 March 2023

After long away, back on this with a new enthusiasm. Progress being made on the most tricky part of the project: my own custom environments. Currently adopted Draw.io as the method of making them.
