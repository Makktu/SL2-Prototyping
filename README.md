# SpaceLander 2 - Prototyping

### 16 January 2023

Started to develop SpaceLander2 ('SL2' from now on). Still at the very early stage of deciding what game mechanics to include. This project is purely a sandbox to test out a few new ideas â€“ starting with the 'Pulser'. This will be a weapon that the SpaceLander of this new game will be able to fire to damage/destroy enemies and obstacles. It will only fire when 'energy' is above a certain amount. Energy will then take time to replenish. The player will have to be cautious about using and overusing the Pulser.

##### Today:

- Set up the playing canvas
- Added the Godot sprite as a placeholder
- Added basic movement
